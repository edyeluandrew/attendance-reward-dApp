attendance-reward-dApp
This is a smart system that is built is soroban and rust 
it has a ui built for it so the ui interrats with the soroban 
so basically when you have a session or an event , it allows you to reward the attendees 
so the attendee simply connects their stellar wallet to the dApp
this helps to sign transactions and for identity 
so they go ahead and checkin the session usng the code provided by the admin 
so after checking in , a dictionary of attendees is created in the admin dashboard 
so after the session (lets say its 2hrs) , the admin does the call of the smart contract from the ui by clicking the send rewards button in the dashboard
attendees an then see their rewards
